### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

As of now, I am not yet profficient on Javascript, but as I am already knowledgeable on basic fundamentals, I will continue familiarizing Javascript before, learning React Js.

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) - This helped me to decide which color pallete suits the best. I really liked this website, and I will use it further more.
